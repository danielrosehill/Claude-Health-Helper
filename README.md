# Claude-Health-Helper

An organized workspace for managing personal health documentation with AI assistance. This repository helps users organize medical records, consultation notes, medication lists, and prepare for healthcare visits.

## Purpose

This repository provides a structured system for:
- Converting loosely formatted medical visit transcripts into organized summaries
- Preparing symptom lists and questions for doctor visits
- Documenting medications and conditions
- Generating layperson-friendly summaries of medical reports
- Organizing imaging results, lab work, and consultation records

## Important Notes

- This tool assists with health information **organization**, not diagnosis
- Always verify AI-generated summaries with healthcare professionals
- Original documents are always preserved alongside generated summaries
